    "text": "Prologue: Prior to the Revolution\nGreat Britain and France fought for control of their colonies, like India and America, from 1754 to 1763. The so-called Seven Years War ended with Great Britain taking over a large majority of the French colonies. When the American Revolution started in 1775, King Louis XVI of France was willing to support America due to its possibility of harming Great Britain and to avenge his grandfather’s loss during the Seven Years War.\n\n\n\n\n\nexhibits.stanford.edu/frenchrevolution\n\n\n\nKing Louis XVI assumed the throne in 1774 at age 19. Although King Louis XVI was educated, he was not properly prepared to govern because he was not expected to become king. He was third in line for the crown until his two older brothers and father died unexpectedly of tuberculosis.\nKing Louis XVI married Marie Antoinette to form a political alliance with Austria. She was known for her beauty and was initially favored by the people of France.\n\n\n\n\nWhat sparked the French Revolution?\nKing Louis XVI was not a great ruler, and his decisions with the country’s money created problems for France. The country had accumulated debt from the Seven Years War and the money he lent to America added to the debt. He and Queen Marie Antoinette spent money on extravagant purchases. They moved from Paris to a lavish palace in Versailles where he and the Queen wasted money on unnecessary things, like parties, clothes, and games.\nWith the debt growing more and more, the king decided to impose heavy taxes onto the people. The prices of food started to soar due to limited food supply from bad harvest and harsh taxes. A single loaf of bread could cost as much as their wages which led people to starve.\nThe situation became so dire King Louis XVI called a meeting of the Estates-General, which had not happened since 1614.\n\nthe three estates, how it was imbalanced\nthird estate was silenced\n\n\n\nWhat happened during the French revolution?\nThe people fed up with his rule took a stand and formed a mob at the Bastille. They killed everyone including the one in charge of that establishment, leaving a massive path of bloodshed. This event helped to inspire Jean Paul Marat, a journalist who helped to garner more people to the cause of the revolution using his papers, as well as William Robespierre, one of the most important people of the revolution which contributed to the Declaration of the Rights of Man and one of the most bloodiest parts of the revolution.\n\n\n\nexhibits.stanford.edu/frenchrevolution\n\n\nAfter the seige of the Bastille, a group of people banded together to create a national assembly. This assembly created The Declaration of the Rights of Man,which was inspired by the Magna Carta and The Declaration of Independence. The Declaration of the Rights of Man helped to lay the framework for the future laws of France.\nAt first, the national assembly wanted a constitutional monarchy: a monarchy in which there are people working alongside the king to control the country.This would later on not be able to come true since the monarchy fought back against them. The people would mob the palace and take the king and queen hostage,moving them all the way to paris,where they stayed in the Tuileries Palace. The king and queen would soon try to flee and try to get help. However, they were caught and soon taken back to the palace. The national assembly soon decided to bring an end to the monarchy after the incident.\nAround this time a war started with Austria. Austria was trying to help save the dying monarchy by fighting back against the republic that was starting to form.All men, from peasants to higher ranking individuals joined the fight for their country, which allowed for peasants to start charging more for their services. Eventually after fighting back against Austria , the assembly decide to kill the king and queen using the guilotine: a device that would be an important form of execution. With that this was the start of the republic the national assembly wanted.\n\n\nShort-Term Reforms from the French Revolution\nDuring these events The National Assembly was working on implementing different laws that would help benefit the French citizens. One of these laws was the outlawing of religion, this was due to the church and the monarchy working very closely together. The church was in a high power position because of their connection and influence over the country. The church also clashed against what the revolution believed in, it viewed the revolution as an enemy to its authority. This affected another law in which it was stated that education would be available to all. However, this was hard to do since there was a lack of educators. Prior to the revolution the church was responsible for providing staff for schools. Many of the schools were owned and staffed by the church. In regions were the school system was succesful, the people were able to find jobs. However, in regions where it wasnt as sucessful there was a major funding crisis for education.\n\n\nThe French Revolution’s Long-Term Impact\nThe French revolution years later had a significant impact on the world. It gave hope to a world filled with tyranny, the revolution spawned many different beliefs and ideologys through out many places. The revolutionh had inspired the independence movement in latin america due to napoleonic residence of spain. Most of the countries declared their independence in the 1820’s. Today the French revolution still has an impact , it established concepts in modern democracy that are incredibly important. It also stands as a reminder of the dangers of the radicalism that had spawned mass bloodshed through-out France.\n\n\nConclusion\nThe French Revolution took place in 1789-1799 as a reaction to the monarchy’s irresponsible rule. The revolution changed many times over the years but one thing remained a constant over the years, their quest for equality and their rights as citizens of France. However, that came with many difficulties, some internal like ensuring reforms and dealing with people defying the revolution, as well as external forces like Austria coming to try and help the dying monarchy of Louis XVI and Marie Antonette."

    "text": "What started the beginning of the French Revolution?\nThe king of France during that time was Louis XV, who had taken over at the age of 15 after his fathers death and was arranged to Marie Antoinette. Louis XV was not a great ruler of france like his predecessors. His leadership had caused to go into more debt than it already was, squandering it on extravagant purchases. As well as helping America, not because of kindness but because he wanted to get get back at England to avenge his father.\nHis indecision of important matters of his country caused many issues. The people fed up with his rule took a stand and formed a mob at the Bastille. They killed everyone including the one in charge of that establishment, leaving a massive path of bloodshed.
